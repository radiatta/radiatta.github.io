title: RedDrop Custom DropBox Api client.
---

<p align="justify"> RedDrop began as a simple implementation for [dropbox api](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/sdks/ios), and it becomes my personal dropbox app. The main reason why i make use of it is its velocity accesing the service. The principal aplication is to share link in times of need an open presentations quicker than using the official app. Obviously just for personal tests. <p>
