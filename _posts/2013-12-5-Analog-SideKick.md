title: Analog Sidekick iOS OpAMP Calculator.
---

<p align="justify"> This is a little tool that became really useful between first year engineers. AnalogSidekick is an app that let you choose between the most common Operational Ampliflier arrangements and calculate the resistance combination needed to get the Gain. Since thi was my first app created with a friend, it was never intended for commercial use on the appstore, and was distributed from phone to phone. <p>
